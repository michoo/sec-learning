# Malware Analysis Report

# Executive Summary
Key takeaways should the reader get from the report regarding the specimen's nature, origin, capabilities, and other relevant characteristics.
- What are its capabilities ?
- How can the program be detected across entreprise systems
- What would data exfiltration look like on the network? 
- Does the program reveal anything about adversaries ?

# Identification
## Filename, File size, File type
## Hashes (md5, sha1, sha256, ssdeep, imphash, Entropy)
## Signing Information (Certificates)
## TrID - Packer info
## Aliases
## Third party analysis (Clamav, virus total, yara rules)
## Malware name (if known)

# Dependencies
Files and network resources related
## OS versions and required initialization files
## DLL/SO
## Executables
## URLS
## Scripts

# Static Analysis
## Top level components
## Execution points of entry
## Embedded strings
## Code related observations (Reflection, Obfuscation, Encryption, Native code, etc)
## File contents
### package contents
### files created/deployed on the system

# Dynamic Analysis
## Network traffic analysis
### DNS Queries
### HTTP Conversations
### TCP/UDP communication
## File operations (files read and written)
## Services/Processes started
## Data leaked

# Capabilities/Behavioral
The specimen's capabilities for infecting files, self-preservation, spreading, leaking data, interacting with the attacker, and so on. For a good reference of what characteristics you may need to capture take a look at the https://github.com/MAECProject/schemas/wiki/Malware-Capabilities
https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown
Describe what the malware can do
- can it infect files?
- can it persist across reboots?
- can it spread to other systems?
- can it leak/exfiltrate data?
- can it communicate with the attacker?
- can it resist analyis?
## Description of characteristics (infecting files, self-preservation, spreading, leaking data, interacting whith attacker,...)
## Recommandations (IOC, step by step cleaning, Yara rules)
